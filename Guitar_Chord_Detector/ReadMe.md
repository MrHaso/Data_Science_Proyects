# Chord Detection Project
## Author: MrHaso 2022

This is a Deep Learning project focused on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks to detect Chords played on a Guitar from a live feed Camera. 
The aim of this project is to understand the architechture of a CNN and its usage, as well as the reality of 'model complexity'. Looking at the results
we can determine that a more complex model will not necessarily perform better than a simpler model for a determined task. This means that experimentation
is the key behind finding a good model for the task at hand. 

A pre-trained model was not used intentionally since the goal of this project was not to use an API but to do the complete process of a Deep Learning project:
  
  1. Data collection
  2. Data Preprocessing
  3. Model Design and Creation
  4. Train / Test the Model
